# Expense-Tracker
##Review:
This is a well-structured and easy-to-understand implementation of a console-based expense tracker. The use of functions for modularity—add_expense(), view_expenses(), total_by_category(), and delete_expense()—is commendable, as it promotes code reusability and readability. The program handles user input effectively with validation through try-except blocks, particularly in the add_expense() and delete_expense() functions, which helps prevent crashes due to invalid input. The use of list and dictionary data structures is appropriate for storing and accessing expense records. The formatting and display of data are user-friendly, with emojis adding a nice touch of UX appeal. However, there is room for improvement: the code could be enhanced by persisting the data (e.g., saving to a file or database), adding input constraints (such as non-negative amounts), and perhaps introducing filters by date or month. Overall, this is a solid foundational script that reflects good programming practices for a beginner to intermediate level.
